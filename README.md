# African Tribe Archive

African Tribe Archive is a web application designed to collect and curate knowledge about African tribes, people groups, and visual traditions across different historical periods.

The project focuses on **gathering lived and cultural knowledge from the public** in a simple, accessible way, without requiring technical skills or GitHub familiarity.

## Purpose

Many accurate details about African appearance, dress, and cultural presentation are not represented in existing datasets.

This application exists to:
- Collect first-hand and community knowledge
- Accept plain-language descriptions and reference images
- Preserve submissions in a structured, reviewable format
- Enable careful curation and later reuse in research and creative projects

## What this project is

- A data collection and curation tool
- Designed for mobile and low-bandwidth access
- Built for non-technical contributors
- Moderated and curated before public use

## What this project is not

- Not a public wiki
- Not a crowdsourced free-for-all
- Not a GitHub contribution project

All submissions are reviewed before inclusion.

## How submissions work

Contributors submit information through a simple web form:
- Name or anonymous
- Tribe / people group
- Region or country
- Era or time period
- Description of appearance and dress
- Optional reference images

The data is stored for review and curation.
